## This project has been made for my web client course at University.

### The goal for the teacher was to made us learn the "sprite" and hitbox concept.

**The project has been made in pure CSS/HTML/JS in order to be play on a computer and not on a phone. **
**You can play with the arrows and start and stop with 's' , do not use ZQSD in order to move !!**
